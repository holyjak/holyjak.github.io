## Jakub Holý @ Holy Dev

Hello! My name is Jakub Holý and I am a full-stack Clojure(Script) developer by day and a pair-programming partner for hire by night via my company Holy Dev. 

I like to learn and think and I share a lot of that at [my blog, Holy on Dev](https://blog.jakubholy.net/), which is my primary presence on the internets and where you can also [learn more about me](https://blog.jakubholy.net/me/), should you be so inclined.
