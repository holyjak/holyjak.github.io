## Holy Dev - a programming buddy for hire

I have established my one-person company Holy Dev in 2021 to give a legal frame to what I love most - helping other people getting better in Clojure and the parts of its ecosystem I know and solving their problems, by means of mentoring, consulting, and pair-programming.

My current focus is primarily on 1-on-1 mentoring and pairing to help folks learn [Fulcro](https://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/), the unique full-stack web framework for sustainable development. A part of the proceeds goes to the sponsorship of Fulcro's author, Tony Kay, and the rest helps me - together with inputs from my awesome mentees - create learning resources such as the [Minimalist Fulcro Tutorial](https://fulcro-community.github.io/guides/tutorial-minimalist-fulcro/index.html), the accompanying [fulcro-exercises](https://github.com/fulcro-community/fulcro-exercises), the [Fulcro Troubleshooting Decision Tree](https://blog.jakubholy.net/2020/troubleshooting-fulcro/), and the [Fulcro Community](https://fulcro-community.github.io/) site.

If you are interested in enlisting my help, and are able and willing to pay â‚¬20/15 min (as of 8/2021) (with a negotiable free trial), do not hesitate to [get in touch](https://blog.jakubholy.net/contact/).
