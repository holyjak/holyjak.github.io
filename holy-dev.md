## Holy Dev - a programming buddy for hire

I have established my one-person company Holy Dev in 2021 to give a legal frame to what I love most - helping other people getting better in Clojure and the parts of its ecosystem I know and solving their problems, by means of teaching, mentoring, consulting, and pair-programming.

### Mentoring

My current focus is primarily on 1-on-1 mentoring and pairing to help folks learn [Fulcro](https://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/), the unique full-stack web framework for sustainable development, and on teaching. A part of the proceeds goes to the sponsorship of Fulcro's author, Tony Kay, and the rest helps me - together with inputs from my awesome mentees - create learning resources such as the [Minimalist Fulcro Tutorial](https://fulcro-community.github.io/guides/tutorial-minimalist-fulcro/index.html), the accompanying [fulcro-exercises](https://github.com/fulcro-community/fulcro-exercises), the [Fulcro Troubleshooting Decision Tree](https://blog.jakubholy.net/2020/troubleshooting-fulcro/), and the [Fulcro Community](https://fulcro-community.github.io/) site.

If you are interested in enlisting my help, and are able and willing to pay â‚¬22<sup>*</sup> / 15 minutes (as of 7/2022) (with a negotiable free trial), do not hesitate to [get in touch](https://blog.jakubholy.net/contact/). Money back guarantee - if you feel my service is not giving you what you expected, say so early, we stop, and you do not pay anything.

_<sup>*</sup> The amount is slightly higher than my salary, to justify both to myself and my family that I am spending even more time in front of the computer. About half of the amount goes to taxes, so that we can have roads and free schools and all the other great things._

#### Testimonials

**Alex Eberts, developer, March 2022**:

> It is my sincere pleasure to recommend Jakub to anyone interested in quickly leveling-up their Clojure and Fulcro knowledge.
> 
> Jakub brings a great understanding of programming fundamentals as well as a thoughtful problem solving approach and combines it with a clear love for helping people improve their skills. With Jakub's help, I went from a frustrated beginner struggling with Clojure and Fulcro basics to feeling right at home at the REPL and confident enough to contribute to Fulcro issues and community documentation.
> 
> While Fulcro's founder, Tony Kay, has provided a comprehensive suite of videos and documentation, learning Fulcro can still be a daunting task for beginners. Having Jakub in your corner is like having your own Fulcro "strategy guide". Jakub helped me make immediate progress on my projects while introducing me to important parts of the bigger picture so I could continue the journey on my own.
> 
> After every one of our sessions together, I come away with workflow tips and Clojure insights that I can put to use in my own code right away. I could not be happier with the coaching I've received from Jakub. In addition to being a great mentor Jakub is also a wonderful human being. Many thanks Jakub!

### Teaching

I can help your group, team, or company get better at Fulcro. I can for example facilitate the workshop [Introduction to creating webapps with Fulcro](https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-intro-wshop) for a reasonable compensation.
